VITARON is the world’s first multimodal, AI-powered non-invasive glucose scanner designed to eliminate painful finger-pricks and expensive consumables. By fusing five independent signals—Raman Spectroscopy, Multi-wavelength NIR, Photoacoustic Sensing, PPG, and RF Dielectric Sensing it overcomes traditional barriers like melanin and hydration etc..,

This repository contains a research prototype implementation that demonstrates:
Sensor-level signal preprocessing pipelines
Feature extraction from each modality
Physics-informed quality metrics
Rule-based multimodal fusion architecture

The current fusion layer is deterministic and model-driven.
A machine learning model has not yet been integrated due to the absence of a clinically validated multimodal dataset.

The feature relationships and baseline data used in this prototype are derived from:
Publicly available laboratory research
Academic publications
Synthetic signal simulations

This codebase is intended for:
Architectural demonstration
Signal processing and validation
Multimodal fusion understanding
